# DAAWG
Bachelor project, DAAWG (Drone Assisted Avalanche Wayfinding Guidance). We seek to automate the "search" part of "search & rescue" using autonomous drone technology.

The DAAWG is an autonomous VTOL drone that deploys from a base station, and autonomously travels to the site of an avalanche. Upon arrival, it calculates a search pattern, and begins searching for victims. It physically marks locations for SAR personnel to excavate.
